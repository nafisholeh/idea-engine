        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          RedditRadar is a tool designed to help entrepreneurs and product developers identify
          promising SaaS opportunities by analyzing discussions on Reddit. We scan thousands of
          posts and comments to identify pain points, solution requests, and emerging trends
          across various categories.

          data-driven insights into what people are actually discussing, struggling with, and
          requesting solutions for.
